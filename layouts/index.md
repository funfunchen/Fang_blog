Hello, I am **Fang Chen**.  

I defined myself as 
**a Genomics Data Scientist**;  
**an Amateur Magician trying to find real power of cards and coins**;    
**a Pythonista and R'er**.

I used to live in **Shanghai**, China. I am living in **Pennsylvania**, USA right now.

I earned my PhD from the Institute of Genetics, Fudan University. After finished my Ph.D. in medical genetics, I decided to go to industry, which was a new world for me. During four years of application and marketing training in [BD](http://www.bd.com/), a global medical technology company, as a product manager, I did very well with my team on integration the business of flow-cytometry products with single-cell genomics application. 
Meanwhile, working in the rapid developing genomics area re-ignited my passion for research. Then I decided to move on and dive into the data-driven intelligence revolution. Genomics is the real big data. **It is a whole new ball game**. Nowadays, the human genome is much easier to sequence but harder to interpret. That’s where **Modern Data Scientists** come in.

这是陈放的个人主页。2012年我从[上海五角场职业技术学院](http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/)毕业，义无反顾的进入职场；在静安嘉里中心的写字楼里做起了市场部工作，花了四年，基本飞遍了全中国，成为一个对各地美食有一点发言权的人；养了猫，时不时和小区业余队伍踢场球；闲下来时，琢磨琢磨魔术。2016年底，我做出了一个决定，回到学校，直飞宾州大农村，在[宾州村办大学医学院](http://med.psu.edu/)再度开启学术之旅。详细的唠叨请见[没有通过镜子测试的人]()。
