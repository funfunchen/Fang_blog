I am Fang.  
I defined myself as a Genomics Data Scientist;  
an Amateur Magician trying to find real power of cards and coins;  
I used to live in Shanghai, China. I am living in Pennsylvania, USA right now.

This site's theme was ported from [Ivy](https://github.com/dmulholland/ivy), a minimalist website generator built in Python. 

All pages not under the root directory of the website are listed below. You can also visit the list page of a single section, e.g., [posts](/post/), or [notes](/note/).
