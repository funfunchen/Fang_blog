Recently, I am learning the **Computer Systems A Programmer's perspective**, which requires the C as a prerequirement. So I had to study the C language.

Although C is thought as old and broken <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>, I found it is elegant and clean (except for poiters, of course). 
C for Computer Science is like Latin for Natural Science (include Math). **Even you won't use it, you should know it.**
