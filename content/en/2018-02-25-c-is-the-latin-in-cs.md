Recently, I am learning the ![CSAPP](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-Engineering/dp/0134123832/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1519607099&sr=8-2&keywords=Computer+Systems+A+Programmer%27s+perspective){:height="50%" width="50%"}, which requires the C as a prerequirement. So I had to study the C language. Although C is thought as old and broken [Learn C the Hard Way][1] and old, I found it is elegant. C for Computer Science is like Latin for Natural Science (include Math). **Even you won't use it, you should know it.**
